# How to Build Your Own Arcade Cabinet

Here’s a guide to get you started from the basics to the final setup, so you can enjoy retro gaming right in your home. Let’s go step-by-step, assuming this might be your first go at it.

## Step 1: Gather Your Supplies
The first step is to gather all the parts you'll need. This includes **joystick controllers, buttons, a screen, speakers**, and the all-important **Raspberry Pi** for running the games. Many people order these parts in kits, making it easy to get everything you need in one go. You’ll also need **plywood**, **wood glue**, **screws**, and a **monitor** that fits the space you’ll have inside the cabinet.

## Step 2: Cut the Plywood for the Cabinet Frame
Start with your cabinet’s blueprint or design – you can find plenty of free plans online or adjust to fit your space and style. If you don’t have experience, stick with a simpler shape; it’ll make things much easier. Carefully measure out and **cut the plywood** to create the sides, front, top, and base of your cabinet. Remember to account for the space needed to mount your monitor and other components.

---

## Step 3: Assemble the Frame
Now comes the fun part: **assembling the frame!** Grab your **wood glue and screws** to attach the plywood pieces, starting with the sides, then adding the base and front panel. Double-check that everything lines up evenly. You may want to drill some pilot holes first to make it easier to screw everything together without splitting the wood. Take your time – this is the foundation for your cabinet.

## Step 4: Sand and Finish the Wood
Once assembled, it’s time to smooth things out. **Sand down** any rough edges on your plywood so the cabinet is safe to touch and looks neat. You can paint it now or after setting up the electronics, depending on your preference. Many people go with classic black or add some retro designs to capture that arcade feel.

## Step 5: Install the Components
Next up, install your **monitor** in the cabinet’s front section, where you’ll see it best. Secure it firmly in place. Mount your **joysticks and buttons** on the control panel – this is the part you’ll interact with the most, so make sure it’s comfortable. Then, add **speakers** for sound, placing them either on the sides or top, wherever they fit best.

---

## Step 6: Set Up the Raspberry Pi
Your Raspberry Pi will be the heart of your gaming experience. Install **RetroPie** (or another emulator software) on the Pi, which allows you to play classic games. Connect the **Raspberry Pi to the monitor** and link it to your joystick and button setup. This is usually done with USB encoders, so it’s plug-and-play. If you’re not familiar with RetroPie, take some time to set it up properly, adding the games you love.

---

## Step 7: Test Everything
Turn on your Raspberry Pi and test each button, joystick, and the monitor to make sure everything is working as expected. If any buttons aren’t responding, double-check the wiring. Adjust the controls and screen position if needed until everything feels right.

---

## Step 8: Finishing Touches
Now that everything works, you can apply any final touches! **Paint** the cabinet, add decals or artwork, and install LED lighting if you want that arcade glow. Finish by securing the back panel to keep everything inside safe and dust-free.

---

## Step 9: Enjoy Your Custom Arcade!
Once all your hard work is done, it’s time to play! Plug it in, pick a game, and let the nostalgia flow. Enjoy your creation – a true homage to arcade classics and a great conversation piece for your home!
